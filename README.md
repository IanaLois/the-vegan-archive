## **AGILE METHODOLOGY**

To strategise the project's development and execution, an Agile Tool in the form of a project Kanban board was employed via Github. The project board utilised issues represented as "User Stories". You can access the board through this [link](https://github.com/users/IanaLois/projects/3).

## **DESIGN**

### **Colours**

<br>

<details>
<summary>Colour Palette</summary>

<br>

<img src="media/tva-color-palette.png" alt="Color Palette" width="45%" height="45%">

</details>

<br>

The colour scheme for this project was obtained from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).
It is a combination of earthy and calming tones:

- #f4f0bb has a warm and soft beige tone reminiscent of sandy beaches or natural fibers. This color exudes comfort and relaxation.
- #1C7866 has a deep and rich green resembling lush vegetation. This color brings a sense of balance and tranquility.

The harmonious interaction of these colours creates a natural connection and a tranquil ambiance, making them suitable for this project that aims to communicate feelings of wellness and unity.

<br>

### **Typography**

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to generate the font family "Hind" and in the event that it doesn't load, it will default to "sans-serif".

- The "Hind" font family was chosen for the entire project because it strikes a good balance between being easy to read, adaptable, and visually pleasing. The clear letter shapes ensure that the text is easy to understand. The font comes in different weights which helps organise headings and text effectively.

Hind's modern yet elegant look matches the project's style well and by using Hind consistently, a cohesive look and feel is created, making the project user-friendly and visually appealing.

## **DEPLOYMENT**

### **Version Control**

The Vegan Archive was created using [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

- ``git status`` command was used to display the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged in the working directory and staging area.

- ``git add .`` command was used to stage all changes in the working directory and its subdirectories for the next commit.

- ``git commit -m “commit message”`` command was used to create a new commit in the Git repository with a specified commit message.

- ``git push`` command was used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.

<br>

### **Heroku Deployment**

**Requirement and Procfile**

- ``pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`` command was used to create a ``requirements.txt`` file.
- A new file named ``Procfile`` was created and a line of code ``web: gunicorn theveganarchive.wsgi`` was added.
- Then everything was pushed to the repository.

**Creating the Heroku App**

- Navigate to the Dashboard after logging into [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- Select **"New"** and then **"Create new app".**
- Name the app and then select the closest region.
- Click **"Create app"** to confirm.

**Creating the Database**

- Navigate to the Dashboard after logging into [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).
- Select **"Create New Instance".**
- Choose the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan and **Name** it, leaving the **Tags** section blank.
- Click **"Select Region"** and select the closest data center.
- Click **"Review".**
- If all details are correct, select **"Create instance".**
- Return to the Dashboard and click on the **database instance name** of the project.
- In the URL section, copy the database URL.
- Ensure that Django and Gunicorn are installed in your workspace by executing the command ``pip3 install Django==3.2.3`` and ``pip3 install gunicorn==21.2.0``.
- Similarly, confirm the installation of the database infrastructure by running ``pip3 install dj-database-url==0.5.0`` and ``pip3 install psycopg2==2.9.7``
- Then ``pip freeze > requirements.txt`` command was used to update the requirements.txt file.

**Setting up Cloudinary**

- Go to the website.
- Click on the **"Sign Up For Free"** button.
- Fill in your name, email address, and choose a password.
- For **Primary interest**, select **"Programmable Media" for image and video API**.
- Click **"Create Account."**
- Verify your email, and you will be directed to the dashboard.

**The env.py file**

- A ``env.py`` file must be present in the working directory and included in the ``.gitignore`` file.
- At the top of the ``env.py`` file, add the line of code ``import os``.
- Below that add the following lines:

  ``os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "copied URL from ElephantSQL database"`` <br>
  ``os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "create a secret key of your own or use a random key generator"`` <br>
  ``os.environ["CLOUD_NAME"] = "from the copied API Environment Variable found in Cloudinary account dashboard, use the characters AFTER @ "`` <br>
  ``os.environ["API_KEY"] = "from the copied API Environment Variable found in Cloudinary account dashboard, use the characters AFTER CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary:// and BEFORE the : "`` <br>
  ``os.environ["API_SECRET"] = "from the copied API Environment Variable found in Cloudinary account dashboard, use the characters AFTER : and BEFORE @ "`` <br>

- Import the environment variables into the ``settings.py`` file.
- Then run ``python3 manage.py migrate`` in the terminal window to migrate the data structure to the database instance.

**Heroku Config Vars**

- Navigate to the Heroku Dashboard and select the **"Settings"** tab in the app that was just created.
- Click **"Reveal Config Vars"**.
- Add the following: <br>

  ``DATABASE_URL`` - ``copied database URL from ElephantSQL`` <br>
  ``SECRET_KEY`` - ``copied secret key`` <br>
  ``CLOUDINARY`` - ``copied API Environment Variable AFTER CLOUDINARY_URL=`` <br>
  ``DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`` - ``1`` <br>

**Connecting to GitHub and Deploy**

- Navigate to the Heroku Dashboard and select the **"Deploy"** tab in the app that was just created.
- Choose GitHub as the preferred deployment method.
- Locate the project repository by name and click **"Connect"** to establish the connection.
- Select **"Enable Automatic Deploys"** if desired.
- Lastly, select **"Deploy Branch"** to initiate the deployment process and observe the app being built.
